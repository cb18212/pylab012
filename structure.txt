I want you to create a solar-system simulation where you
can add planets and, of course, a sun. The simulation should
be able to move the planets with respect to the sun's
mass and size and, of course, gravity. The simulation should
also be able to show where each planet is located at any given
period. The Sun should be the center of the solar-system, so
coordinate (0.0, 0.0). Each Planet should also have a coordinate
position (hopefully not at 0.0, 0.0), a mass and size, and at any
point I want to know its distance from its sun. Lastly, because
this is a simulation, we should be able to move the planet and
get and set its position and velocity.
